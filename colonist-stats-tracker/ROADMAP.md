# Colonist.io Stats Tracker — Roadmap

Non-urgent ideas to revisit later. Nothing here blocks the current release, and this
file is excluded from the packaged `.zip`.

## Planned

### Use colonist's own dice artwork for the dice-face view
The digit ⇄ dice toggle currently draws its **own** SVG dice (rounded face + a light
gradient sheen + real pips, with the 1 and 4 pips in red, Asian-dice style). A nice
consistency win would be to use **colonist's real dice images** instead, so the panel
matches the board exactly.

Approach (in-game, self-healing — mirrors how the resource-card art is already handled):

- When a roll message is parsed, cache each die image's live `src` into a `DICE_ICON`
  map. The URLs carry a per-deploy content hash (e.g. `dice_3.<hash>.svg`), so they
  must be read from the live game log, not hard-coded.
- Render the cached image when available; **fall back to the built-in SVG dice**
  otherwise.

Why it's deferred: colonist's real dice assets aren't available in every context — the
static `preview.html`, before the first roll of a game, or right after a colonist
redeploy changes the hash (404). So the robust default must stay the self-drawn dice;
the real-image path is an enhancement layered on top, not a replacement.

## Minor polish (low priority, TBD)

Stan has a few small UI tweaks in mind that aren't important — to be listed and
revisited here later.

<!-- Stan: add items as they come up -->

### Observed candidates (surfaced during code review — optional)

- **Dice-pip legibility at very small widths.** The dice faces are em-sized, so at the
  narrow/small preset the pips get small. It's fine in the large preset (where auto-mode
  shows dice); only relevant if dice are ever *manually* forced on a narrow panel.
- **Rapid double-click on the value toggle isn't fully serialised.** It always settles
  on the correct mode; only the in-between frame can flicker. A generation token would
  make it bullet-proof if it ever becomes noticeable.
